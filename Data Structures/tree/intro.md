----------------------------------------------------------------

A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

# Why Tree Data Structure?
----------------------------------------------------------------
In order to perform any operation in a linear data structure, the time complexity increases with the increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in today's computational world.

Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.
